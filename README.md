Installation of Minecraft Java Edition doesn't work

I wanted to install a Minecraft Java Edition License on our new notebook, but when the game is started we get an exit warning. 

The error pid is enclosed. Is anyone out there who could help  me? My son is very sad, because he has waited for a long time to play this edition.
Many thanks in advance!
